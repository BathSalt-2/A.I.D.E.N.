# Bugfix: Handle missing edge case in sweep function
# --------------------------------------------------
# We noticed that the 'sweep' function was not behaving as expected under certain conditions.
# Specifically, the bug was located in the 'file.py' module, where the sweep function was not
# handling a specific edge case properly.
#
# This bugfix introduces a conditional statement to handle the missing edge case. Now, the
# sweep function checks for this specific condition before proceeding, ensuring that it
# behaves as expected in all scenarios.
#
# Here's an example of the updated code:
#
# Before:
# def sweep():
#     # some code here
#
# After:
# def sweep():
#     if missing_condition:  # new conditional statement
#         handle_missing_condition()
#     # some code here
#
# Labels: sweep, bugfix, edge case
