# This is the configuration file for Sweep AI, a tool that turns bug fixes & feature requests into code changes.
# The file is written in YAML format and contains various settings that control how Sweep operates.

# The 'branch' field specifies the default branch that Sweep will use for creating pull requests.
# This is typically the main or master branch, and should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes.
branch: 'main'

# The 'gha_enabled' field controls whether Sweep will use the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions.
# If set to True (the default), Sweep will use this information to generate code changes.
# If set to False, Sweep will not use this information and will instead rely on other sources.
