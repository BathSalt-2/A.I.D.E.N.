# This is the configuration file for Sweep AI, a tool that turns bug fixes & feature requests into code changes.
# The file is written in YAML format and contains various settings that control how Sweep operates.

# The 'branch' field specifies the default branch that Sweep will use for creating pull requests.
# This is typically the main or master branch, and should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes.
branch: 'main'

# The 'gha_enabled' field controls whether Sweep will use the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions.
# If set to True (the default), Sweep will use this information to generate code changes.
# If set to False, Sweep will not use this information and will instead rely on other sources.
gha_enabled: True

# The 'description' field provides a brief overview of your project, which will be used by Sweep when creating pull requests.
# This is a great place to describe what your project does, what frameworks or technologies it uses, and any other relevant information.
# If left blank, Sweep will use a default description.
description: ''

# The 'default_values' field specifies the default values for various Sweep settings.
# These values can be overridden in individual task configurations.
# For more information on these settings, see the Sweep documentation.
# Here's an example: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweep.yaml
